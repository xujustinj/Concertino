# Concertino

This spreadsheet was created for the "Internal Assessment" final project in a grade 11 information technology course (International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme, "Information Technology in a Global Society", Standard Level). I consulted my piano teacher as my client, and designed a scheduling tool to suit his needs. It needed to contain a database and also display the schedule in a calendar. At the time I figured that I could use VBA to set up macros and forms to emulate MS Access in Excel, where I could display the calendar on a sheet. In hindsight, it was probably better off building Concertino in Access and using VBA to emulate Excel instead.

Included in this repo is the final version of Concertino submitted for the course. No further iteration has been made on it, except to refill personal information with garbage data. Due to the relational nature of the database, the example functionality is unaffected.
